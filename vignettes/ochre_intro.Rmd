# Introduction

"Welcome to all people... To this land of ochre" - Ruby Hunter

The [**ochre**](CRAN link?) package contains colour palettes inspired by the Australian landscape, iconic Australian artists and images. 

# Installation

``` r
install.packages("ochre")
```

**Or the development version**

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/ochre")
```

# ochRe palette choices

The package contains fourteen colour palettes.


```{r use_names, echo=TRUE}

# See names of all palettes
names(ochre_palettes)
```

```{r see_palettes, fig.height = 8}
pal_names <- names(ochre_palettes)

par(mfrow=c(7, 2), lheight = 2, mar=rep(1, 4), adj = 0)
for (i in 1:length(ochre_palettes)){
    viz_palette(ochre_palettes[[i]], pal_names[i])
}
```


## Colour vision impairment
These plots show how each of the palettes perform for different types of colour vision impairment (using dichromat). Palettes that perform best are "galah", "namatjira", "williams_pilbara", and "healthy_ _reef"  

### Green-Blind (Deuteranopia)
```{r dichromate_deat, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow=c(7, 2), lheight = 2, mar=rep(1, 4), adj = 0)
for (i in 1:length(ochre_palettes)){
    viz_palette(dichromat(ochre_palettes[[i]], "deutan"), pal_names[i])
}
```


### Red-Blind (Protanopia)
```{r dichromate_protan, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow=c(7, 2), lheight = 2, mar=rep(1, 4), adj = 0)
for (i in 1:length(ochre_palettes)){
    viz_palette(dichromat(ochre_palettes[[i]], "protan"), pal_names[i])
}
```


### Blue-Blind (Tritanopia)
```{r dichromate_tritan, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow=c(7, 2), lheight = 2, mar=rep(1, 4), adj = 0)
for (i in 1:length(ochre_palettes)){
    viz_palette(dichromat(ochre_palettes[[i]], "tritan"), pal_names[i])
}
```


### Desaturated
```{r desaturate, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow=c(7, 2), lheight = 2, mar=rep(1, 4), adj = 0)
for (i in 1:length(ochre_palettes)){
    viz_palette(desaturate(ochre_palettes[[i]]), pal_names[i])
}
```

# Usage

The ochRe functions `scale_colour_ochre` and `scale_fill_ochre` are designed to be used with ggplot2. 

```{r eg2}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + 
   geom_point(aes(colour = factor(cyl))) +     
   scale_colour_ochre(palette="olsen_qual")

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
   scale_colour_ochre(palette="winmar")

 ggplot(diamonds) + geom_bar(aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
   scale_fill_ochre()

```

```{r eg1}
library(scales)
show_col(ochre_pal()(10))
filled.contour(volcano,color.palette = ochre_pal(256), asp=1)

```
